# SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT: HSH
HSH is a simple implementation of a shell written in C language. The basic functionality of the shell is to display a prompt, read a line of input given by the user, parse the input into individual tokens, search for the tokens in the PATH or in the built-in commands, and execute the command before looping back to the prompt.
